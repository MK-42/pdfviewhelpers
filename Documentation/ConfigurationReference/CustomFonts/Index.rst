Custom Fonts
------------

Adding custom fonts is as easy as providing the path to the TTF file within your TypoScript settings.
The name of the font is automatically generated by TCPDF using the font file name. Only the characters a-z, 0-9 and _ are allowed and words like
'bold', 'oblique', 'italic' or 'regular' are replaced by 'b', 'o', 'i' or ''.

**Example**: ROBOTObold.ttf becomes robotob

TypoScript
""""""""""

::

	plugin.tx_pdfviewhelpers.settings.config.fonts {
		addTTFFont {
			roboto {
				path = EXT:pdfviewhelpers/Resources/Public/Examples/FullFeatureShowCase/Roboto.ttf
				# it is also possible to define the type of the font
				# possible values are TrueTypeUnicode, TrueType, Type1, CID0JP = CID-0 Japanese, CID0KR = CID-0 Korean, CID0CS = CID-0 Chinese Simplified, CID0CT = CID-0 Chinese Traditional
				# can be left out in order for TCPDF to auto detect the type
				# type = TrueTypeUnicode
			}
			opensans {
				path = EXT:pdfviewhelpers/Resources/Public/Examples/FullFeatureShowCase/OpenSans.ttf
